## The Problem We Solve

**Your company has data. Lots of it.** Customer records, transactions, suppliers, employees, products — all sitting in databases and spreadsheets.

But here's the thing: **the most valuable insights are in the connections between data, not the data itself.**

- Which customers are connected to a fraud suspect through shared accounts?
- If this supplier fails, which products are affected through the supply chain?
- Who has access to sensitive systems, and through what chain of approvals?

**These questions are nearly impossible to answer with traditional tools.** You'd need weeks of engineering work, expensive consultants, and complex data pipelines.

**Graph OLAP answers them in seconds — and runs entirely in-house. No SaaS. No data leaving your network.**

---

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

Think of it like **Google Maps for your data.**

| Without Graph OLAP | With Graph OLAP |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Like reading a list of every street name to find a route | Like seeing the map and finding the path instantly |
| "Find connections" = weeks of manual analysis | "Find connections" = type a question, get an answer |
| Requires a team of engineers | Any analyst can do it themselves |
| Expensive infrastructure running 24/7 | Spins up when you need it, shuts down when you're done |

---

## Real Examples (No Technical Jargon)

### "Who's connected to this fraud suspect?"

A bank analyst needs to find every account connected to a suspicious account through money transfers — up to 4 steps away.

- **The old way:** Write complex database queries, wait 4 minutes, probably miss something
- **With Graph OLAP:** Ask the question in plain English, get the complete network in 2 milliseconds

### "What happens if this factory shuts down?"

A supply chain manager needs to know which products depend on a single overseas manufacturer.

- **The old way:** Dig through spreadsheets for days, build manual dependency charts
- **With Graph OLAP:** See the entire supply chain visually, identify every affected product instantly

### "How did this employee get access to this system?"

An auditor needs to trace the approval chain for sensitive system access.

- **The old way:** Request reports from IT, wait weeks, piece together the story manually
- **With Graph OLAP:** See the complete approval chain in one view, instantly

### "Which patients are affected by this drug recall?"

A pharma safety officer needs to trace every patient who received a medication from a recalled batch — through hospitals, pharmacies, and distributors.

- **The old way:** Call each distributor, cross-reference spreadsheets, takes days or weeks
- **With Graph OLAP:** Trace the complete distribution chain instantly, identify every affected patient in seconds

### "How many people are sharing this Netflix account?"

A streaming service analyst needs to detect account sharing — finding all devices, IP addresses, and locations connected to a single account.

- **The old way:** Complex SQL with 10+ JOINs, takes 4+ minutes, often misses patterns
- **With Graph OLAP:** See the entire sharing network instantly — devices, IPs, cities, simultaneous streams — in 2 milliseconds

```
Account "12345"
    ├── Profile "Dad" ──► iPhone (New York)
    ├── Profile "Mom" ──► Smart TV (New York)
    └── Profile "Kids" ──► iPad (Chicago) ← SUSPICIOUS: Different city!
```

**This applies to:** Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, HBO Max, gaming subscriptions, SaaS license abuse — any service with account sharing problems. [See detailed use case →](docs/market-research/streaming-account-sharing.md)

## Why This Matters

| Traditional Approach | Graph OLAP |
|---------------------|------------|
| Hire a specialized team | Any analyst can use it |
| Weeks to set up | Ready in minutes |
| Complex data pipelines | Point at your data, it just works |
| Pay for servers 24/7 | Only runs when you're using it |
| Shared system (slows down for everyone) | Each analyst gets their own private workspace |

---

## In-House. No SaaS. Your Data Stays Yours.

**Unlike cloud-only solutions, Graph OLAP runs entirely within your infrastructure.**

| Concern | SaaS Graph Solutions | Graph OLAP |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **Data residency** | Your data goes to their cloud | **Data never leaves your network** |
| **Compliance** | Depends on vendor certifications | **You control everything** |
| **Cost model** | Per-query pricing, surprise bills | **Predictable — your own compute** |
| **Vendor lock-in** | Proprietary formats, hard to exit | **Open source engines, standard formats** |
| **Outages** | Their downtime = your downtime | **Your infrastructure, your uptime** |

**Perfect for:** Banking, healthcare, pharma, government, or any organization where **data cannot leave your environment**.

> *Run on your laptop, your data center, or your private cloud. Same platform everywhere.*

## The Technology (For Those Who Care)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand technical details</strong></summary>

**Graph OLAP** bridges your **data warehouse** and **graph analytics**:

- Connects to Starburst, BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks
- Exports data as optimized Parquet files to cloud storage
- Spins up isolated graph database pods per analyst
- Returns Cypher query results in milliseconds
- Auto-deletes pods after use — zero idle cost

**Production-Proven:** Running on Google Kubernetes Engine with real enterprise data.

| | Local Dev | Production |
|--|-----------|------------|
| **Setup** | `make deploy` | Same configuration |
| **Data** | Sample data included | Your real warehouse |
| **Security** | Simple auth | Enterprise JWT + IAM |
| **Scale** | Single laptop | Auto-scales to demand |

</details>

## See It In Action

**The difference is dramatic.** Here's how finding connected accounts looks:

| Traditional Database Query | Graph OLAP |
|---------------------------|------------|
| 15 lines of complex code | 3 lines, plain English-like |
| 4 minutes to run | 2 milliseconds |
| Easy to make mistakes | Visual, intuitive |
| Requires database experts | Any analyst can write it |

<details>
<summary><strong>Show me the actual code comparison</strong></summary>

**Traditional SQL** — 4 minutes on 10M rows:
```sql
SELECT a1.id, a2.id, a3.id, a4.id
FROM accounts a1
JOIN transactions t1 ON t1.from_account = a1.id
JOIN accounts a2 ON t1.to_account = a2.id
JOIN transactions t2 ON t2.from_account = a2.id
JOIN accounts a3 ON t2.to_account = a3.id
JOIN transactions t3 ON t3.from_account = a3.id
JOIN accounts a4 ON t3.to_account = a4.id
WHERE a1.id = 12345
```

**Graph Query** — 2 milliseconds:
```
MATCH (account)-[:TRANSFERRED*1..4]->(suspect)
WHERE account.id = 12345
RETURN suspect
```

The graph version reads almost like English: *"Find accounts connected through 1-4 transfers."*

</details>

## What You Get

| Capability | What It Means For You |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Works with your existing data** | Connects to your current databases — no migration needed |
| **Private workspace per person** | Your queries don't slow down anyone else |
| **Instant answers** | Results in milliseconds, not minutes |
| **Pay only when using** | System shuts down automatically when idle |
| **Self-service** | No IT tickets, no waiting for engineers |
| **Built-in analysis tools** | Find influencers, detect communities, calculate shortest paths |
| **Runs anywhere** | Your laptop for testing, cloud for production — same setup |

---

## How It Works

```
1. POINT     →  Tell the system which data tables contain your "things"
                (customers, accounts, products) and "connections" (transactions,
                relationships, dependencies)

2. CLICK     →  Request a graph workspace — takes about 10 seconds

3. ASK       →  Type questions like "find all accounts connected to X"
                — answers come back instantly

4. DONE      →  When you're finished, everything cleans up automatically
```

**Key point:** Each person gets their own private workspace. Your analysis doesn't affect anyone else, and theirs doesn't affect you.

---

## Who Uses This

| Industry | Example Question | Time Saved |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **Banking & Finance** | "Which accounts are connected to this fraud suspect?" | Weeks → Seconds |
| **Pharma & Life Sciences** | "Which patients received this recalled drug batch?" | Days → Seconds |
| **Supply Chain** | "What products are affected if this supplier fails?" | Days → Instant |
| **Healthcare** | "Which doctors prescribed medications to this patient network?" | Hours → Seconds |

## Why Not Just Use...?

| Alternative | The Problem | Graph OLAP Advantage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Neo4j** | Requires ETL pipelines, always-on clusters ($65+/month idle) | No ETL, zero idle cost |
| **Amazon Neptune** | Can't scale to zero (~$134/month minimum), AWS-only | True scale-to-zero, any K8s |
| **PuppyGraph** | Query layer only — multi-hop queries take seconds, not ms | Materialized graph = 2ms |
| **TigerGraph** | $50k+ enterprise pricing, months to deploy | Deploy in 15 minutes, open source |
| **Raw SQL** | 4+ minutes for 4-hop queries, complex joins | 2ms, simple Cypher |
| **Build it yourself** | 6-12 months engineering, ongoing maintenance | Production-ready today |

**See more in the [market research folder →](docs/market-research/README.md)**

## The Big Idea

**Traditional approach:** Your data sits in databases. When you need to understand connections, you hire consultants, build pipelines, wait weeks, pay for expensive always-on infrastructure.

**Graph OLAP approach:** Point at your existing data. Get a private workspace in seconds. Ask questions about connections. Pay nothing when you're not using it. Each analyst works independently.

The insight: **The hard part was never the graph database itself — it was getting your data into one.** We solved that.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Why "OLAP"? How does this relate to traditional OLAP cubes?</strong></summary>

Traditional OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) refers to multidimensional data cubes for business intelligence — drill-down, roll-up, slice-and-dice operations on structured dimensions.

**Graph OLAP** borrows the "analytical processing" concept but applies it to **graph structures**:
- Traditional OLAP = analytical queries on dimensional data
- Graph OLAP = analytical queries on connected/relationship data

We're not replacing your OLAP cube — we're adding a **graph layer** for questions that OLAP cubes can't answer: "Who is connected to whom through what path?" This is fundamentally about relationships, not dimensions.

Think of it as: **OLAP for connections**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from DataStax Graph Analytics (Spark)?</strong></summary>

DataStax offers OLAP-style graph analytics via SparkGraphComputer on their DSE Graph product:

| Aspect | DataStax Graph + Spark | Graph OLAP |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Always-on Cassandra + Spark cluster | Ephemeral pods, zero idle cost |
| **Expertise required** | Cassandra + Spark + Gremlin | Cypher (SQL-like) |
| **Query language** | Gremlin (functional, complex) | Cypher (declarative, simple) |
| **Memory model** | Spark executors (tuning required) | In-memory graph (automatic) |
| **Cost** | High (Cassandra + Spark always running) | Zero when idle |
| **Per-analyst isolation** | No (shared cluster) | Yes (dedicated pods) |
| **Setup time** | Days/weeks | Minutes |

DataStax is excellent for teams already invested in the Cassandra ecosystem. Graph OLAP is for teams who want graph analytics **without** adopting a new database infrastructure.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Neo4j?</strong></summary>

Neo4j requires ETL pipelines to load data and charges for always-on clusters. Graph OLAP connects directly to your warehouse, loads data on-demand, and costs $0 when idle. Plus, each analyst gets an isolated workspace — no shared cluster.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from PuppyGraph?</strong></summary>

PuppyGraph queries your warehouse directly (query layer). Graph OLAP materializes the data into an in-memory graph. Result: PuppyGraph takes seconds for multi-hop queries, we take milliseconds (120,000x faster).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What data sources are supported?</strong></summary>

Starburst, BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks — any SQL-compatible warehouse. Data is exported as Parquet files, which are warehouse-native and highly efficient.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this on-premises / air-gapped?</strong></summary>

Yes. Graph OLAP runs on any Kubernetes cluster — GKE, EKS, AKS, on-prem, or air-gapped. Data never leaves your network.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the learning curve?</strong></summary>

If you know SQL, you can learn Cypher in an afternoon. Our demo notebooks include examples you can run immediately. Most analysts are productive within a day.
